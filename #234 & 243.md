## Proposal 243 â€“ OpenGov Community Voting Discord Bot

The below information is all taken from on-chain data.
Token Holders are completely within their rights to vote on any referendum that they wish. This is in no way a complaint about the system, whale accounts, or how anyone is voting.
In a similar fashion, it is completely fine to investigate on-chain data to identify accounts that are linked to each other.

4-Aug-23 at the same time as the above accounts lowering to 1x conviction, DKPTcrQCX4op7MbBGTDUGtRJ1VHnPWqr1CSqUMr8bz17hZE, FUFgDE24fyYqW4jiQ87tzjK2zBBSixvXhyjgegQCjuyfJja, DREQKFXhEa7UxRqwkih4xHUEcg2B1eDLe4nKzfwaNbwf9pZ, and CsDsqzXnnY12g8r1St1iKz4JQo2mj8gJE1opppCNPvWrBL3 remain at 4x conviction. The vote now sits at 72.2% aye, with 374.62k AYES and 144.42K NAYS.


At the peak of the voting there were 389,060 KSM in the AYE direction and 318,550 KSM in the NAY direction. If we assume 1 KSM is 1 vote (ignoring conviction) this is a total voting turnout of ~$15,779,000 based on the 7D EMA price of $22.30 USD for a referendum to award $2,000.

Here is some data about this groups voting power:

| 1 | FS32DgoVLooSr6DzBLqjZmw33PWXhiDJWdr11krthLxKiaf | 10070 | 6 | 60420 | $1,344,166.00 |

    Total KSM: 10070 + 9180 + 5518 + 5518 + 5800 + 4200 + 9627 = 51913 KSM
    Total Votes: 60420 + 55080 + 33048 + 33048 + 34800 + 25200 + 57762 = 299358 votes

### Proposal #234  https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/referendum/234

#234 starts passing on 27th July with several large wallets voting aye using x4 & x5 conviction

![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/sHS6Wyo.png) ![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/z2Gfemj.png)

Towards the end, these wallets switched to 0.1 conviction, causing #234 to fail on (46.4% Aye | 53.6% Nay). The same wallets also voted against #243 with high conviction before lowering it & removing some votes 1 day after initially voting.

`H1ppdY` receives some KSM from `Gk63x35M5hLDTMdmW8GXoY1jzoHWyQ4WSZBcBUiRAemvvum` (846+ days ago):

If we look at `Gk63x35M5hLDTMdmW8GXoY1jzoHWyQ4WSZBcBUiRAemvvum`, it's last set of transactions was 846+ days ago to `H1ppdY` and also `P2P.ORG`
